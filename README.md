# Secure-data-hiding-in-image-using-steganography


. The project adds an extra layer of protection by requiring a passcode for decryption, ensuring that even if someone discovers the hidden data, they cannot access it without the correct password.
. This technique is practical for secure communication, digital watermarking, and protecting sensitive information without drawing suspicion.
. Unlike traditional encryption methods that make data visibly scrambled, steganography hides data within an image, making it undetectable to the human eye. This adds a layer of security through obscurity.

In this Project , The  using Libraries and Platforms are:
Libraries 
OpenCV – For image processing tasks  and handling images files .
OS – Used for opening the image file after encryption.
Platforms
Windows and Linux
Tools 
Visual Studio Code – Code editor for development
Pycharm - For running the scripts
Pip - For Installing dependencies
